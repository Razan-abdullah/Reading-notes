# 1-What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the evaluation of expressions rather than the execution of commands. Erlang programming language is described as a functional programming language.


# 2-What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

A pure function is a function which: Given the same input, will always return the same output. Produces no side effects.


# 3-What are the benefits of a pure function?

- encourage safe ways of programming .
- easy to test and refactor .
- memoizable .
-  lazy .


# 4-What is immutability?

can’t be changed after it was created .


# 5-What is Referential transparency?

The expression referential transparency is used in various domains, such as mathematics, logic, linguistics, philosophy and programming. It has quite different meanings in each of these domain. Here, we will deal only with computer programs, although we will show analogy with maths (simple maths, don’t worry). Note, however, that computer scientists do not agree on the meaning of referential transparency in programming. What we will look at is referential transparency as it is used by functional programmers.
