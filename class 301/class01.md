# Introdiction to React and Components

> React is one of the most used libraries across the world in front end development and it is one of the most needed skills in the tech field nowadays.


## 1-What is a  _"component"_?
A component is a software object, intended to interact with other software objects "components"., each perform a specific action and it is reusable.
## 2-What are the characteristics of a  _"component"_?**

- **Reusable**; it is like initializing one button for example and be able to use it in multiple places instead of initializing multiple buttons.

- **Replaceable**; may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific**; designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- **Extensible**; can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior, for example, a prompt, its context can be different from the original component.

- **Encapsulated**; it allows its functionality to be used without exposing its internal processes, variables or state.

- **Independent**; it can operate as a standalone object.

## 3-What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

- **Ease of deployment**; easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- **Reduced cost**; The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- **Ease of development**; Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- **Reusable**; The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.


## 4-What is "_props"_ short for?**

 is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

## 5-How are _"props"_ used in React?**

 Define an attribute and its value(data).


## 6-What is the flow of _props_?

Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow (one way from parent to child). Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
